I am professor of Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering at the University at Buffalo.

I try to use fundamental principles of dynamics and computational mechanics to tackle problems 
across a broad range of applications, including seismic integrity of infrastructure components, 
interaction effects in high-speed trains and even some biology problems. 
I enjoy doing computations as well as physical experiments.

I teach undergraduate classes in the areas of mechanics, computational methods and experimental methods.
